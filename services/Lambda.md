# AWS Lambda
Lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers or containers, you pay only for the compute time you consume.

## General Notes
- Brief history:
    - Data Centre: on-prem
    - IaaS: EC2
    - PaaS: Elastic Beanstalk
    - Containers: ECS
    - Serverless: Lambda
- Benefits:
    - **Serverless**
    - Continuous scaling
    - Low cost
- Common use cases:
    - **Event-driven applications**, where the Lambda functions runs your code in response to events such as changes on S3 bucket or DynamoDB table
    - **API** where it runs your code in response to HTTP requests using API Gateway or AWS SDKs
- Languages supported:
    - Node.js
    - Java
    - Python
    - C#
    - Go
    - PowerShell
    - Ruby
- **Price** is based on:
    - **Number of requests**
        - First 1 million requests are free (per month)
        - $0.20 per million requests after that
    - **Duration**
        - Calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 100ms
        - Price depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function, you are charged $0.00001667 for every GB-second used
- Amazon Alexa is powered by Lambda
- **Scales out (not up) automatically**
- Lambda functions are **independent**, 1 event = 1 function
- Lambda functions **can trigger other lambda functions**
- **Architectures can get extremely complex**
    - AWS X-Ray allows you to debug
    - Additional effort to test, deploy and manage multiple environments as the application grows
- Lambda can do things globally, such as backing up S3 buckets to different regions
- There is a concurrent execution limit that **limits the number of concurrent executions across all functions in a given region per account**
    - Default to 1,000
    - Returns TooManyRequestsException, HTTP Status Code 429
    - You can request a limit increase to AWS Support Center
    - You can **reserve concurrency** to guarantee that a set number of executions will always be available for your critical function. But it still acts as a limit
- You can enable Lambda to access **VPC resources**, allowing the function to connect to the private subnet
    - You need the following VPC configuration:
        - Private subnet ID
            - Is recommended to select at least two subnets in different AZs for high availability
        - Security group ID (with required access)
            - The lambda execution role needs permission to create the ENIs
        - Lambda uses this info to setup an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) using an available IP address from your subnet
    - `aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name my-function --vpc-config SubnetIds=subnet-123abc,SecurityGroupIds=sg-123456`

## Triggers
- Services that **Lambda reads event from**:
    - Amazon Kinesis
    - Amazon DynamoDB
    - Amazon SQS
- Services that **invoke Lambda functions synchronously**:
    - Elastic Load Balancing (Application Load Balancer)
    - Amazon Cognito
    - Amazon Lex
    - Amazon Alexa
    - Amazon API Gateway
    - Amazon CloudFront (Lambda@Edge)
    - Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
    - AWS Step Functions
    - Amazon Simple Storage Service Batch
- Services that **invoke Lambda functions asynchronously**
    - Amazon Simple Storage Service
    - Amazon Simple Notification Service
    - Amazon Simple Email Service
    - AWS CloudFormation
    - Amazon CloudWatch Logs
    - Amazon CloudWatch Events
    - AWS CodeCommit
    - AWS Config
    - AWS IoT
    - AWS IoT Events
    - AWS CodePipeline

## Vesion Control
- You can publish one or more versions of your Lambda function
- These versions can be used as different stages of your development workflow, such as development, qa and production
- Each Lambda function has an **unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN)**, after publishing a version, **it is immutable**
- The latest function code is in **$LATEST version**, when you update your function code, it **replaces the code in $LATEST**
- You can refer to a Lambda function using its ARN. There are two types of ARN associated with the latest version
    - **Qualified ARN**: the function ARN with the version suffix
        - arn:aws:lambda:aws-region:acct-id:function:helloworld:$LATEST
    - **Unqualified ARN**: the function ARN without the version suffix
        - arn:aws:lambda:aws-region:acct-id:function:helloworld
- You can set **alias** to a specific version and use it to map different stages, such as **PROD**, **QA** and **DEV** for example, remapping the alias as you promote changes between environments
    - You can **shift traffic** between two versions, based on weights (%), this is useful for **A/B testing/Blue-Green deployments**
    - Cannot split traffic using $LATEST, you'll need to create an alias to latest
