## Study plan
1. Start with the [exam blueprint](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-dev-associate/AWS_Certified_Developer_Associate-Exam_Guide_EN_1.4.pdf), so you are aware of:

    - How the exam works
    - What is in scope
2. Plan your study schedule 
    - Study at least 30min everyday
    - Take the time to focus only on that: no phone, no social media, no multitasking
    - Keep track of the days you studied and compensate in the next day if necessary
3. Take the preparation course on Udemy and AWS training and make sure that for each subject you:
    - Put the hands-on and do the labs
    - Read related whitepapers and FAQs in AWS
    - Take the practice tests, if any available specifically for the subject
    - Save all code samples, notes and useful links on repository for later reference
    - Clean-up any resource created in AWS during the labs to avoid unnecessary costs
4. Schedule and pay the exam
5. Take the practice tests on Whizlab
    - Reserve some time to focus on it, as if it was the actual test
    - Take notes of the questions that are not clear or that you missed
6. Review the notes and questions for each subject
7. Ace the exam!
