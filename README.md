    - Take the practice tests, if any available specifically for the subject
    - Save all code samples, notes and useful links on repository for later reference
    - Clean-up any resource created in AWS during the labs to avoid unnecessary costs
4. Schedule and pay the exam
5. Take the practice tests on Whizlab
    - Reserve some time to focus on it, as if it was the actual test
    - Take notes of the questions that are not clear or that you missed
